      <description>I’ve been searching and searching the internet for someone, somewhere who might know how to enable correct IntelliSense for cshtml (MVC 5.0) in VS2013 when developing in a ClassLibrary type project.
This is the problem I was encountering:
Missing Intellisense
It’s all thanks to Mohammad Chehab, who was also stumped for a while (probably not as long as me), that I was able to find the solution. His blog post explains that one must change the output path for the class library to bin/ (instead of bin/) for Intellisense to work.</description>
