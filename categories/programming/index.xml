      <description>Filesystem I have always been a bit confused when working with cmake’s file functions and the logic behind paths (sometimes they are found sometimes they are not…) For ease of use I reimplemented a own path managing system which behaves very similar to powershell and bash (see ss64.com) it is based around a global path stack and path qualification. All of my functions which work with paths use this system.</description>
